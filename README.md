## Issues and Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Issue: Location Permission Denied
- **Description:** Users may encounter issues with location permission being denied, preventing the application from fetching weather data.
- **Troubleshooting Steps:**
  1. Ensure that the app has been granted location permissions on the device.
  2. Check the device settings to verify that location services are enabled for the app.
  3. If running on a simulator, ensure that location simulation is enabled and configured correctly.

Issue: API Request Failures
- **Description:** Users may experience failures in fetching weather data due to network issues or incorrect API key configuration.
- **Troubleshooting Steps:**
  1. Check the network connection to ensure it is stable.
  2. Verify that the Tomorrow.io API key is correctly configured in the application.
  3. If using a proxy server, ensure that it is properly configured to allow API requests.

 Issue: Loading Spinner Stuck
- **Description:** Users may encounter situations where the loading spinner remains visible indefinitely, indicating an ongoing data fetching process.
- **Troubleshooting Steps:**
  1. Check the network connection to ensure that the application can communicate with the API server.
  2. Inspect the console for any error messages related to failed API requests.
  3. If the issue persists, try restarting the application or refreshing the page.
